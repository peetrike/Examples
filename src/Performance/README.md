# Performance examples

Here are some scripts to test different ways to do the same thing in Powershell.
Scripts measure time to perform the tasks.

## Requirements

Some scripts require module [BenchPress](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Benchpress)
to be present on local system.  These scripts usually have `.benchmark` attached
to the end of script name.

For more performance tests, look at https://github.com/StartAutomating/Benchpress/tree/master/PowerShellPerformance

Scripts that run also in PowerShell 2 use module [measure.psm1](measure.psm1)
from this directory.
